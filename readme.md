## 🏫 Introduction
**Academia Arena** is a two-player strategic card game inspired by *Gwent* and *Hearthstone*, where players battle for academic dominance in a university-themed battlefield. This project is a passion-driven prototype created by David Weng and is now available as an open-source project on GitHub.

## 🧠 Core Concept
Academia Arena revolves around deploying Character and Event cards across three Academic Fields:
- **Presentations**
- **Assignments**
- **Exams**

Players accumulate **Credits** (points) and activate abilities through strategic placement and trait-based synergies.

---

## 🧬 Trait System
At the beginning of the game, each player is randomly assigned a unique combination of three **Traits**:
- **Background**: e.g., Domestic, International, Minority
- **Physiological**: e.g., Gym Bro, Skinny Nerd, Physically Impaired
- **Psychological**: e.g., ADHD, Tourette's, Depression

These traits affect gameplay through passive buffs or active abilities that shape each match’s strategy.

## 🕹️ Game Flow
1. **Start**: Each player receives Traits and a hand of cards
2. **Turn Actions**:
   - Play a Card
   - Use a Trait Skill
   - Pass
3. **End of Round**:
   - Triggered when both players pass
   - Calculate total Credits to determine winner of the round (called a *Semester*)
4. **Victory**:
   - First player to win **2 Semesters** wins the game (*Academic Year*)

## 🗂️ Resource Management
Players don’t fully redraw each round—careful planning and resource conservation are key. You might have to **sacrifice a round** to **win the war**.
