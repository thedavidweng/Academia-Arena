[System Context]

You are an expert game developer and software architect. Please communicate and think in Chinese (请全程使用中文进行思考和沟通). Rebuild the existing primitive prototype of "Academia Arena", a 2-player strategic browser-based card game. Read the existing prototype directory to extract the raw material: Card data (Traits, Characters, Events) and Synergy definitions.

[Tech Stack & Architecture]

Use React and TypeScript for the entire application.
Use boardgame.io for the core game logic, state machine, turn/phase management, and move validation. Leverage its built-in AI (MCTS or simple rules) to provide a single-player experience. **The game logic must be strictly decoupled from the UI (isomorphic) to ensure the same `Game` object can be used both locally in the browser and on a future Node.js server without modification.**
Use Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for building the frontend components, with `react-i18next` for i18n (EN/ZH support).
**Initialize with boardgame.io's "Local" mode (Client-side only) to ensure the game is "ready to play" instantly upon opening.** Plan for eventual multiplayer state synchronization via WebSockets (e.g., PartyKit or a custom Node.js server), but maintaining local pass-and-play as the baseline.

[UI/UX Design Specifications]

Ensure high-quality CJK typography layout and multi-language support (i18n).
Rely exclusively on clean lines, solid colors, and subtle native shadow depths. Exclude emojis, glowing effects, and bright/neon palettes.
**Read `DESIGN.md` and the reference images in `docs/stitch/` to understand the visual language (Institutional Brutalism, sharp 90-degree angles, specific color palette, and layering principles).**

[UI/UX Strategy & Decision]
*   **Component Choice**: While `shadcn/ui` is recommended for its robust logic, its default "Modern SaaS" aesthetic (rounded corners, soft grays) conflicts with "Institutional Brutalism". You must decide:
    1.  Use `shadcn/ui` but **strictly override** all CSS variables (force `radius: 0px`, custom surface colors).
    2.  Or use a more minimal/headless approach if it better serves the sharp, blocky, editorial-heavy look.
*   **Iconography**: `lucide-react` icons are often too rounded/friendly. Evaluate if more geometric/technical icon sets (e.g., `Radix Icons`, `Remix Icon`) better match the "Redacted Dossier" feel.
*   **Layout**: Avoid standard "grid of cards". Use aggressive asymmetry and background color shifts (Surface Shifting) as defined in `DESIGN.md`.

[Standard Board Game Features]
1. Undo/Redo: Support move rollback within the current turn.
2. Game Log: A detailed, brutalist-styled activity log showing every card played and stamina spent.
3. Replay: Basic support for reviewing previous moves in the current session.

[Game Mechanics Integration]

Implement the core rulebook within the boardgame.io setup:
1. Three lanes: Presentations, Assignments, Exams.
2. Random starting Traits allocation (Background, Physiological, Psychological).
3. Dynamic Stamina System: Assign initial Stamina based on the inverse weight of the rolled Traits.
4. Stamina Actions: Provide UI components for players to spend Stamina on "Probability Lock" (guarantees synergy success), "Status Override", and "Draw Card" during their turn.
5. Best-of-3 round system. Ensure hand and Stamina resources persist across rounds.

[Execution Steps]

1. **Extraction**: Parse `index.html` to extract `cardLibrary` and `traitLibrary`. Save them as clean TypeScript constants in `src/data/entities.ts`.
2. **Scaffold**: Initialize the project environment (Non-interactive mode preferred):
   ```bash
   # Initialize Vite (Force install in current directory)
   npm create vite@latest ./ -- --template react-ts
   
   # Install Dependencies
   npm install boardgame.io lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   
   # Initialize shadcn/ui (Use default prompts)
   npx shadcn-ui@latest init -d
   ```
   *Note: Migrate existing music/PDFs from `./assets/` to `./public/` for static asset accessibility.*
3. **Core Logic**: Build `src/game/game.ts` using `boardgame.io`. Define the `G` state, `moves`, `phases`, and `AI` (using `MCTS` or `RandomBot` for testing).
4. **i18n**: Implement `src/i18n/` configuration. Ensure all UI text and card descriptions are available in both English and Simplified Chinese. *Reference `readme.md` and `readme.zh-CN.md` for consistent terminology (e.g., Presentations/演讲, Credits/学分).*
5. **UI Components**: Create high-fidelity components based on `DESIGN.md` and `screen.png`.
6. **Integration & Testing**: Connect the `Board` component to the `boardgame.io` Client. Perform full round testing.
7. **Workflow**: 
   - Commit after every major functional block (e.g., "feat: game logic", "feat: ui components").
   - Finally, generate a summary of changes and prepare for PR submission.

After all features are implemented, perform a rigorous self-test ensuring the best-of-3 logic, stamina persistence, and i18n work correctly. Finally, create a branch and submit the code as a PR for merging.
